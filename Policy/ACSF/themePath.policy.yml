title: "ACSF default theme path"
class: \Drutiny\Acquia\Audit\AcsfDefaultThemePath
name: Acquia:SiteFactoryDefaultThemePath
description: |
  Ensure there are no hard coded references to the default theme path in the
  deployed theme as this can and will cause a lot of HTTP 404s.
remediation: |
  Use a preprocess hook, and inject the path to the asset, using a function such
  as `drupal_get_path()`.
success: "No default theme paths found."
failure: |
  Default theme path issue{{plural}} {{prefix}} found
    {{# issues}}
      - {{ . }}
    {{/issues}}
